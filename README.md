This project is Chess built entirely with Ruby to be played in the terminal between two human players.

Each type of piece has its own class that defines the characteristics specific to that piece. Most of these piece classes inherit from a sliding piece (queen, rook, bishop) or stepping piece (knight, rook) class which defines the way the piece moves about the board. Pawn is a special case die to the complexity of its movement. The sliding piece, stepping piece, and pawn classes all inherit from a general piece class. The players can move their pieces around the board using the standard chess coordinate system where numbers represent the rows and letters the columns. (PICTURE OF MOVE) The game will alert the user with custom messages if the move they attempt to make is illegal and allow the user to move again. (PICTURE OF INVALID MOVES) When pieces are captured, they will be displayed next to the board. (PICTURE OF CAPTURED PIECES) The game will not allow the user to make a move that will put them in check. (PICTURE OF MOVE INTO CHECK) The game checks all moves for the current player and if it can't find a valid move (one that will keep the current player out of check), it knows that the current player has lost.
